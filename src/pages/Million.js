            During the height of COVID-19, Viterbo Universitys musical theater students came together virtually to perform A Million Dreams. I edited this video to bring their voices and performances to life, seamlessly weaving together individual recordings into a cohesive and moving final piece. This project not only highlighted the resilience and creativity of the performers but also captured the spirit of connection and hope during a challenging time.
